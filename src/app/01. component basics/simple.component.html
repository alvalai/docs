  <!-- we use *ngFor to loop over an array. Here we also assign index to i,
  so that we can have access to it, which for example is useful when you have an edit button
  for each element in the array. Then you can determine by the index which element
  the user wants to edit. -->

      <!-- (click)="displayNameIndex(i)" is how we handle events, in this case we say that we want the displayNameIndex method to handle the click event
      and we want the index as an argument. We use index to bind a dynamic data-warning attribute so it is easier
      to locate that button during unit testing -->

  <!-- *ngIf is how we can conditionally show elements in our UI.
  We use template ref (#defaultText) to speficy what should be displayed in the else case.
