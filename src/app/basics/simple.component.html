    <!-- we use *ngFor structural directive to loop over an array and repeat the template that is inside
    the element that we have attached *ngFor to. In this case we repeat the list element
    for each name that we have in the array -->

      <!-- (click)="displayNameIndex(i)" is how we handle events, in this case we say that we want
      the displayNameIndex method to handle the click event and we want to pass in the index
      of the list item that was clicked. We use index to bind a dynamic data-warning attribute
      so it is easier to locate that button during unit testing.
    
      We use a mat-raised-button attribute directive that is exported by MatButtonModule to modify our button
      element. You can read more about attribute directives from here: https://angular.io/guide/attribute-directives -->
      <button mat-raised-button color="primary" (click)="displayNameIndex(i)" [attr.data-list-button]="i">
        <!-- this is how we pipe a value. here we chain two pipes, first we trim the name -->
        {{name | trim | uppercase}}
      </button>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- *ngIf is how we can conditionally show elements in our UI.
  We use template ref (#defaultText) to speficy what should be displayed in the else case.

  NB! We use data-attributes here to simplify locating the element during testing. We use them
  as a reference when we are querying for the div element. We could do diferentiate this div by using
  a class or an id, but then we would be coupling our unit tests to them. If we would change
  the name of the class or id then we would have to also change our test. -->
  <div data-warning *ngIf="displayWarning(); else defaultText">
    You have been warned!
  </div>
  <ng-template #defaultText>
    <span data-no-warning>
      Nothing to see here!
    </span>
  </ng-template>
